                    <h3>1. Single clipping path</h3>
                    <p class="text-justify">For this service, we only make a path for one image. The single clipping
                        path is divided into

                    <p class="text-justify"> Basic/simple clipping path is typically applied in an exceedingly straight
                        or rectangular
                        product with no hole or a minimum differ of holes. If you would like to induce eliminate the

                    <p class="text-justify">The medium clipping path contains multiple holes and multiple curves. It's
                        generally more stable
                        than the compound clipping path. If you'd prefer to remove the background of a medium image like
                        associate jewelry with multiple holes, you'd prefer to use many anchor points. Turn out a
                        clipping mask adding the anchor points around the jewelry. Then you've needed to create a path
                        on the holes. For multiple holes, turn out multiple ways on the holes. That's but you'll get the
                        whole background removed.</p>
