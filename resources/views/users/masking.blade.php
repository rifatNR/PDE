                        the image remains untouched. It is used to remove any unnecessary part of an image.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">Advanced Photoshop skills and techniques are essential for the perform

                        clipping path of individual hair and fur images.</p>

                        labor is the perfect creator-- each strand of hair accounted for in the finished image. We start
                        along straight edges with hand-drawn clipping paths and then get more advanced work of
                        preserving the finer details.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">The background eraser tool, the color separation technique, and a magic
                        eraser tool or a
                        combination of more than one help you to achieve the perfect photo for the online clients.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">It is very important to attention on image masking to be consistent with

                        manufactures image profile creation. Specifically, the most essential to follow the manufactures
                        image guidelines of third-party's selling sites like Amazon, Alibaba or eBay.</p>
                    <h2>How many types of Image Masking are there?</h2>
                    <p class="text-justify">There are various types of image masking process. It much depends on the
                        subject and the project.
                        If you are a business starter and have a great product line, you can follow these or a
                        photographer, but you have very little time to work on these and learn about these types of
                        image masking that you can use to make changes to your photo. You can also hire professionals
                        for this particular work. Here are the types of image masking:</p>
                    <h3>Photoshop layer masking</h3>
                    <p class="text-justify">There are many options in photoshop to use for editing purposes. And one of
                        those options is
                        masking. It makes a different layer above the image and helps do various graphical changes.</p>
                    <h3>Clipping mask/ mask clipping</h3>
                    <p class="text-justify">Process that determines the transparency of the subject or the layer. It
                        works slightly
                        differently from the regular masking layer. It works inversely.</p>
                    <h3>Image masking Alpha</h3>
                    <p class="text-justify">This image masking process helps you to change the background of the image.
                        It is pretty similar
                        to a clipping mask. But it uses the contrast to select the background of the subject and enables
                        precise edging. It is more effective than other methods.</p>
                    <h3>Edges refine Image masking</h3>
                    <p class="text-justify">This particular type of image masking makes the edges of the image softer as
                        it will look it is
                        natural. Using this technique, you can edit on humans, dolls, trees, and grass.</p>
                    <h3>Color masking of an image</h3>
                    <p class="text-justify">This masking technique is unique. You can use this process to see the hollow
                        lines and make sure
                        they are not there. It is a process that you can do before color correction.</p>
                    <h3>Collage subjects</h3>
                    <p class="text-justify">Apparently, this is the most common way people use to attach any subject to
                        any photos. But the
                        critical factor is color. You can add anything; however, you can add any matter you want without
                        color, but it will not look good. You will need the same color profile of both the cropped photo
                        and the original photo.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">These are the primary methods of image masking. There are widely know and
                        used for editing images
                        professionally. Professional editors use this graphical method to enhance the quality of a
