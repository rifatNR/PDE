                    <h2>Recommendation</h2>
                    <p class="text-justify">We recommend you to take our service rather than doing it yourself. Photo manipulation is a very
                        complicated service that needs lots of experience. It is not something that you want and
                        change.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">Photo manipulation service requires time and skill. Indeed you can do better if you complete a
                        course of photo editing. There are a lot of courses online so search and find one that is
                        suitable for you. But it will not be a smart choice.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">No matter what you do or try. You can't edit these photos yourself. So hire someone professional
                        or go for an online image manipulation service. They are much more time and cost-efficient than
                        any other method. Here at Photo Design Expert. We give great emphasis on the product and the
                        user.</p>
